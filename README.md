lsvd is a nifty utility to list the video durations of a given set of files.

Given a list of files or directories, lsvd will print out the total sum of the video file durations/lengths. There are also functions in my code that are useful for extracting the durations of video files.

At the end of the list of files is the sum of all the video lengths.

This utility is incredibly useful if you are on a schedule and need to know how long it will take to watch a long list of videos ahead of time. I am currently using it to plan out viewing lectures for the free online courses offered by Stanford.

> Usage: lsvd [OPTIONS] [FILES/DIRS]  
> Lists the total sum of the video lengths of the FILES/DIRS given as command-line arguments  
> OPTIONS: -h, --help: Prints this message.
