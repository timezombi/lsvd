This is still a work in progress. Do not use yet.

lsvd is a nifty utility to list the video durations of a given set of files.

If lsvd is given a directory, it will find all the movie files in the directory and list their individual video durations.

At the end of the list of files is the sum of all the video lengths.

This utility is incredibly useful if you are on a schedule and need to know how long it will take to watch a bunch of
videos ahead of time. I am currently using it to plan out viewing lectures for the free Stanford Online Courses.
